Cell Shape Feature Analysis
===========================

Cell shape feature analysis performs classification of global morphological cell shape
features for cell classification. This analysis pipeline was first pioneered and described
in our paper "In vivo 3D profiling of site-specific human cancer cell morphotypes in zebrafish"
(`Link to paper <https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202109100>`_) and applied here to identify
changes in morphology over hours of imaging and during macrophage-cancer cell interactions.

The pipeline calculates 12 global morphological shape feature for classification:
volume, surface area, solidity, sphericity, longest length, extend, aspect ratio, roughness,
volume sphericity, radius sphericity, ratio sphericity, and circumscribed sphere area ratio.

These feature span a space which is reduced through PCA analysis to two dimensions for visualization.

To run the script, the data should be in the following format:

.. code-block:: none

    .
    |-- TimeSeries
    |   |-- t00000
    |   |   |-- Cell1
    |   |   |   |--segmentedImage.tif
    |   |   |-- Cell2
    |   |   |   |--segmentedImage.tif
            ...
    |   |-- t00001
    |   |   |-- Cell1
    |   |   |   |--segmentedImage.tif
    |   |   |-- Cell2
    |   |   |   |--segmentedImage.tif
            ...

Running the Matlab code
=======================

If you run the Matlab, please first add the Matlab folder Highres_curvature to your active
`Matlab search path <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/addpath.html>`_. Next,

Matlab compiled version
=======================

If you do not have access to Matlab, we provide a compiled version of the code as ".exe" file.
To run it, please double click on the compiled version and follow the installation instructions.
In the installation process also a `Matlab runtime <https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html>`_
environment is installed to run the code. After installation, the compile code is ready to run.
When prompted, please provide the path to the folder with all the timepoint paths (e.g. TimeSeries folder above).

Test data for cell shape feature analysis
=========================================

Test data is available for the cell shape feature analysis on Synapse in the folder
Code_Example_Datasets/Exemplary_ShapeFeatureAnalysis:

It contains a folder to a collection of cells from two timepoints.
