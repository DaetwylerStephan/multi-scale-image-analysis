Self-driving, multi-scale image analysis
========================================

**Self-driving, multi-scale image analysis software** is an open-source collection of Python
and Matlab code to analyse custom multi-scale light-sheet microscope data
of low- and high-resolution data.

All the codes described here are used in our associated preprint:

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.28.582579v1

and the Github repository for all the code is here:
