Self-driving, multi-scale image analysis
========================================

**Self-driving, multi-scale image analysis software** is an open-source collection of Python
and Matlab code to analyse custom multi-scale light-sheet microscope data
from continuous, long-term, simultaneous low- and high-resolution imaging.

If you use this code, please cite our preprint:
"Imaging of cellular dynamics *in vitro* and *in situ*: from a whole organism to sub-cellular imaging with self-driving, multi-scale microscopy"
